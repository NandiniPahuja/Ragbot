# Knowledge Base for RAG Law Student Helper

Place your law-related `.txt` or `.pdf` files (case summaries, statutes, class notes, entire penal code, constitution, FAQs, etc.)
in this directory. Each file should contain text content that you want the chatbot to reference during conversations.

Example:
- `intro.txt`
- `faq.txt`

Ensure files have the `.txt` or `.pdf` extension.
